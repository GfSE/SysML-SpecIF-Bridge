# SysML-SpecIF-Bridge
A bridge between SysML and SpecIF.

## Purpose
An investigation of the [Lehrstuhl f√ºr Virtuelle Produktentwicklung (VPE)](https://vpe.mv.uni-kl.de/startseite/) at the TU Kaiserslautern has shown, that an exchange of SysML data between any of the widely known modeling tools is practically impossible because of compatibility issues. Correctly transferred model-elements and properties are a minor share, even though the XMI standard is being used by all tools.

The SpecIF Initiative is pursuing two goals:
- provide a working model interchange format for SysML modeling tools of a different kind.
- provide a mapping, so that SysML models can be integrated with results from other methods, such as process modelling (BPMN) or requirements engineering. A common context shall allow to search, navigate and audit the integrated model data.

So far, it is unclear whether both goals can be achieved with a single SysML-SpecIF mapping or whether specialized mappings with different design goals will be necessary.
